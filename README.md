# What is Intex?
Stands for Integrated Experience, a.k.a the semester final team project. This project was done Fall 2021.

## Opioid Epidemic Web App
We made a web app with Python Django that implemented CRUD operations for opioid data for the state of Utah. Our app also utilized some machine 
learning models to make predictions about the likelihood that a medical provider would prescribe opioids to a patient.

A majority of the CRUD logic is contained in OpioidID/views.py.
